    <h1 style="color:white;">Lesson 0: What is Lua, and what is it used for?</h1>
    <a style="color:white"> 
        Lua is a dynamic programming language that is known for it’s speed, short learning curve, and use in embedded systems. It’s extremely lightweight, making it easy to embed into applications such as Roblox Studio and World of Warcraft. It is also commonly used as a scripting language for game development, but has also been used to develop applications such as Nmap,a application used to discover hosts and services on a computer network. 
    </a>
    <h3 style="color:white;">Why should someone learn Lua?
    </h3>
    <a style="color:white"> 
        Lua is a good language to get started with in computer programming due to it’s minimal syntax, making it easy for beginner programmers to understand fundamental concepts in a short period of time because of it’s simplicity. 
    </a>
    <h3 style="color:white;">What will these tutorials teach you?
    </h3>
    <a style="color:white"> At Lua learning we will teach several fundamental concepts of lua, such as printing, data types, variables, properties, functions, parameters and returns, if statements, scope, loops, operators, and breaks and continues in the Roblox Studio game engine.

<h1 style="color:white">Lesson 1: Printing</h1>
<h3 style="color:white;">The basics of inputs and outputs</h3>
<a style="color:white"> 
    Before we can dive in to the world of programming, there is a fundamental concept we need to cover. Programming is made up of a sequence of inputs and outputs to and from the computer. Now, you’re probably wondering: What is an input and output? 

First off, great question! Second, an input is something that provides or gives something to the computer. Some common examples of inputs are keyboards, computer mice, and microphones. When you connect these items to the computer and use them, they transmit information to the computer to do a specific task such as typing letters and numbers, voice transmission and being able to navigate your computer. 

Now that we know what inputs are, what are outputs?
Outputs are information that the computer displays after there is an input. Some examples of outputs are being able to see what you’ve typed on a keyboard, voice transmission from the input of your microphone so others can hear you, and being able to see your arrow move when you move your mouse.

<h3 style="color:white;">What is a terminal? 
</h3>
<a style="color:white"> 
    Another important feature that you will need to know before you delve into the world of programming is what a terminal is. A terminal is a screen that conveys outputs from a computer, that you can also communicate with. We will be using a terminal a lot in these lessons, called an output console.

    <h3 style="color:white;">What is printing?
</h3>
<a style="color:white"> The first programming lesson we will be going over in this set of tutorials is printing. Now, the main question is: what is printing? 
    Printing is the process of creating input lines in a block of code, and converting whatever text you like to an output in an output terminal. There are many uses for printing, but the most common are to test different parts of code to identify underlying issues when they run the code that they’re testing. 
    
    The most common example of a print statement is 
    “print(“Hello World!”)
    
    On the output console (Also known as a terminal) , you should see on the bottom the words: “Hello World!”. 
    
    Instead of “Hello World” you can type in whatever you want in between the quotation marks, and it will print!
